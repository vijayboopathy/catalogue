# Dev

Platform supported : Ubuntu 16.04

Following are the instructions to setup a dev environment for catalogue.

```
sudo su
apt-get update && apt-get install -yq curl git wget
cd /tmp

echo "I: Setting up path for go and gvt"
export GOPATH=/opt/go
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export PATH="/opt/go/bin:$PATH"

mkdir /opt/go

echo "I: Install go from source..."

wget -c https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.8.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf go1.8.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local


echo "Validating..."

go version

echo "Install gvt..."
go get -u github.com/FiloSottile/gvt
which gvt

echo "I: Setup the repo..."
mkdir -p /opt/go/src/github.com/microservices-demo
cd /go/src/github.com/microservices-demo
git clone https://github.com/udbc/catalogue.git


echo "I: Compile the code ..."
cd catalogue/
cp -r images /images

# Make sure you have mysql connection configurations done before launching the app
#echo "172.20.0.2 catalogue-db" >> /etc/hosts

/app/main -port 7081
```

## Production Deployment

### Create DB and load the schema

Install mysql and codereate a  database

e.g.
```
dbname: catalogue
user: devops
password: GKkdw72Jil0ld

```

Upload the schema to database created above.

path to schema :  **data/dump.sql**

### Deploy static  assets

  * Fetch the latest [release artifact from this URL](https://github.com/udbc/catalogue/releases)
e.g.
```
wget -c https://github.com/udbc/catalogue/archive/1.0.1.tar.gz

```
  * Extract the artifact, and copy images directory

e.g.
```
tar -xzf 1.0.1.tar.gz
cd catalogue-1.0.1
cp -r  images  /images
```


### Deploy the Catalogue App

Create releases directory

```
mkdir /opt/apps/catalogue/releases

```
Download the [release artifact from this page](http://165.227.64.79:8080/)

e.g.

```
cd  /opt/apps/catalogue/releases

wget -c http://165.227.64.79:8080/catalogue
```


where **catalogue** is a binary

create a symlink
```
ln -s mkdir /opt/apps/catalogue/releases/catalogue /opt/catalogue

```

Launch the app
```
/opt/catalogue -port 80 -images=/images/ -DSN 'dbuser:password@tcp(localhost:3306)/databasename'
```

e.g.
```
/opt/apps/catalogue -port 80 -images=/images/ -DSN 'devops:GKkdw72Jil0ld@tcp(localhost:3306)/catalogue'

```

### To build this service

#### Dependencies
```
go get -u github.com/FiloSottile/gvt
gvt restore
```

#### Go tools
In order to build the project locally you need to make sure that the repository directory is located in the correct
$GOPATH directory: $GOPATH/src/github.com/microservices-demo/catalogue/. Once that is in place you can build by running:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/microservices-demo/catalogue/cmd/cataloguesvc/
go build -o catalogue
```

The result is a binary named `catalogue`, in the current directory.

#### Docker
`docker-compose build`

### To run the service on port 8080

#### Go native

If you followed to Go build instructions, you should have a "catalogue" binary in $GOPATH/src/github.com/microservices-demo/catalogue/cmd/cataloguesvc/.
To run it use:
```
./catalogue
```

#### Docker
`docker-compose up`

### Run tests before submitting PRs
`make test`

### Check whether the service is alive
`curl http://localhost:8080/health`

### Use the service endpoints
`curl http://localhost:8080/catalogue`

### Push the service to Docker Container Registry
`GROUP=weaveworksdemos COMMIT=test ./scripts/push.sh`

## Test Zipkin

To test with Zipkin

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-zipkin.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose-zipkin.yml up
```
It takes about 10 seconds to seed data

you should see it at:
[http://localhost:9411/](http://localhost:9411)

be sure to hit the "Find Traces" button.  You may need to reload the page.

when done you can run:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-zipkin.yml down
```
